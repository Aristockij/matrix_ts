        "title": "How is the Matrix of Destiny different from a regular horoscope or numerology?",
        "content": "Horoscopes are based on&nbsp;stars, numerology on&nbsp;numbers. The Matrix of&nbsp;Destiny uses Tarot archetypes to&nbsp;&laquo;translate&raquo; your birth date into deep meanings and life scenarios. It&nbsp;offers a&nbsp;more symbolic and psychologically accurate picture."

        "title": "How accurate and reliable is it?",
        "content": "The method is&nbsp;based on&nbsp;years of&nbsp;practice and thousands of&nbsp;readings. People often find explanations for their actions, fears, and desires in&nbsp;the Matrix. It&rsquo;s not an&nbsp;absolute truth, but a&nbsp;highly accurate &quot;map&quot;&mdash;its value depends on&nbsp;your readiness to&nbsp;listen to&nbsp;yourself."
